# Feature Extraction


Phishing websites have several criteria that distinguish them from legitimate ones. To make an end to phishing,
 many solutions were proposed in the literature. 
 We were mostly motivated by the [survey suggested by Dr Rami M. Mohammad](http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/24236/), a software engineer graduated
  from the University of Huddersfield.

### Feature Groups
These features could be divided into 4 groups:

-   **URL based Features** : These are the features that analyze the URL of the website.

-   **Abnormal based features** : These features deal with servers and require the use of third parties such as WHOIS database.

-   **HTML and JavaScript based features** : For these features , we used the Web Scraping technique in order to extract data from the HTML and JavaScript code.

-   **Domain based features** : These features extracted from the WHOIS Database .

Currently, this project could extract 19 different features from each website.


### Feature Details

Below, we give you the names of the features used by their group:

|Feature Group | Features' Names |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|URL based features | Having IP address <br/> URL length<br/> URL having "@" Symbol<br/> HTTPS token in the domain part of the url<br/> Shortening services<br/> double\_slash\_redirecting<br/> Prefic\_Suffix in the domain<br/> Having subdomains<br/> sum\_of\_symbole\_eq<br/> sum\_of\_symbole\_and<br/> exist\_of\_symbol\_ab<br/> exist\_of\_symbole\_anch |
|Abnormal based features | URL of Anchor <br/> SFH <br/> Port|
|HTML and JavaScript based features | Redirect <br/> IFrame <br/> Redirect\_html| 
|Domain based features | Age of Domain <br/> Domain registration duration|
 





Below, are the details of each feature ,and the rule behind its extraction:

|Feature Group | Feature’s Name & Details |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Having IP address | If the domain part has an IP address : return 1 otherwise : return -1 |
|URL length | If URL length < 54 : return -1 else if 54<=URL length <=75 : return 0 else : return 1|
|URL having "@" Symbol | If having « @ » symbol then : return 1 else : return -1|
|HTTPS token in the domain part of the URL | If using HTTP token in domain part of the URL: return 1 otherwise return -1|
|Shortening services |  If using shortening services : return 1 else : return -1|
|double\_slash\_redirecting | If the existing of « // » in the path part of the URL : return 1 else : return -1|
|Prefix\_Suffix in the domain | If the domain name part including « - » symbol : return 1 else : return -1|
|Domain registration duration | If Domain expires on ≤ year : return 1 else if domain expires on ≥ 1 year : return -1 else record in WHOIS not existing : return 0|
|Having subdomains | If number of subdomains >1 : return 1 else if number of subdomain <=1 : return -1 else if (TLD non-existing in Mozilla's TLD list) : return 0|
|Port | If the number of port used is of the preferred status(fig1) : return -1 else : return 1|
|sum\_of\_symbole\_eq | If the number of « = » symbol < 3 : return -1 else : return 1|
|sum\_of\_symbole\_and | If the number of « & » symbol < 3 : return -1 else : return 1|
|exist\_of\_symbol\_ab | If the URL has « ~ » symbol : return 1 else : return -1|
|exist\_of\_symbole\_anch | If URL has « \# » symbol : return 1 else return -1|
|URL of Anchor | If \% of URL anchor < 31\% : return -1 else if \% of 31\%≤ URL anchor ≤ 67\%: return 0 else : return 1|
|Redirect | If the website has been redirected less then 2 times : return -1 else if it has been redirected twice : return 0 else : return 1|
|Redirect\_html | If the number of redirections in the HTML DOM =0 : return -1 else  : return 1|
|IFrame | If using Iframe : return 1 else return 0|
|Age of Domain| If age ≥ 6 months : return -1 else if no WHOIS record : return 0 else : return 1 |
|SFH| If the SFH contains empty string or "about:blank" : return 1 else if SFH doesn't exist : return 0 else : return -1 |
